# My very first Web Page

Welcome!

This website can be found here: https://maururo.github.io/streamoneRuben/

It's a practice excercise where I have learned how to use Github, Gitpod and Git.
The website contains an overview over "streams" and the content of the streams: educational blocks indicating when one is to study which code language/framework.

It uses list items in a nav element to navigate between the three streams through anchors.
